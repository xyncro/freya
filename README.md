# Freya

## Overview

Freya provides the Freya meta-packages (batteries included stacks for Freya) including the Hopac variant of the Freya stack. The Freya meta-package depends on parts of the Freya stack to give a good default install, to which other optional elements of Freya can be added.

This repository also serves as the main project issue tracking and communication point, as the stack is split across multiple repositories. The repositories are listed below.
