**NOTE: Freya (and associated component libraries) has been archived for now. The ideas in Freya are still more than worthy of investigation, but the community adopted more conventional approaches to web development, making maintenance for Freya a challenge. For those who used Freya and contributed thoughts, encouragement, and code, thank you!**

**The ideas in Freya may well be resurrected at a later date, possibly on other platforms...** 

# Freya

## Overview

Freya provides the Freya meta-packages (batteries included stacks for Freya) including the Hopac variant of the Freya stack. The Freya meta-package depends on parts of the Freya stack to give a good default install, to which other optional elements of Freya can be added.

This repository also serves as the main project issue tracking and communication point, as the stack is split across multiple repositories. The repositories are listed below.
